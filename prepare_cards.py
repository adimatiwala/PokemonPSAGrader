    The images have a grade at the top; automatically remove the grade.

    Parameters:
    -------
    dir: folder directory of images
    grade: the PSA Grade

    Returns:
    --------
    None

    Iterates through the directory and crops the score out of the image
        1) Removes images whose width are not 300 Â± 5px wide as the scraped images all have a height of 500px
        2) If the images is valid it crops the top 1/5 of the image
        3) Saves the new image

    This is a simple method at filtering images that are not in the proper format.
